# Advanced Financial Analytics System

Welcome to the Advanced Financial Analytics System, designed to provide deep insights into financial markets with a special focus on forex markets. This project utilises historical data and economic indicators to forecast movements in forex rates, particularly the EURUSD pair, and integrates financial news sentiment to enhance predictions.

## Project Overview

This project aims to blend quantitative financial analysis with machine learning and data science techniques to predict forex market trends and provide actionable insights. By analysing the EURUSD currency pair, alongside other potential forex pairs, the system explores correlations between macroeconomic indicators and market movements.

## Project Structure

- `/data` - This folder contains datasets used in the project, including historical EURUSD rates and economic indicators.
- `/docs` - Documentation and additional resources related to the project.
- `/models` - Contains predictive models developed for forecasting currency movements.
- `/notebooks` - Jupyter notebooks for exploratory data analysis, model development, and visualization.
- `/scripts` - Automation scripts for data collection, preprocessing, and model evaluation.

## Key Features (Planned)

The following are key features planned to implement in this project. They are designed to provide comprehensive insights into forex market trends, particularly focusing on the EURUSD pair:

- **Time Series Analysis**: Application of ARIMA and LSTM models to predict future forex rates based on historical data.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Integration of sentiment analysis techniques to gauge market sentiment from global financial news and its impact on forex prices.
- **Economic Indicator Analysis**: Examination of the influence of major economic announcements and indicators on forex markets.
- **Data Visualisation**: Development of interactive dashboards using Plotly/Dash for real-time data visualisation and analysis.

Please note that these features are in the planning stage and may evolve as the project progresses. Check back for updates as I advance through the development stages.
