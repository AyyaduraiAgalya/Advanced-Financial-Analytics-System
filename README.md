# Advanced Financial Analytics System

Welcome to the Advanced Financial Analytics System, designed to provide deep insights into financial markets, with a particular focus on forex markets. This project leverages historical data and economic indicators to forecast movements in forex rates, especially the EURUSD pair, and integrates financial news sentiment to enhance predictions.

## Project Overview

The project aims to blend quantitative financial analysis with machine learning and data science techniques to predict forex market trends and provide actionable insights. It specifically focuses on the EURUSD currency pair, exploring correlations between macroeconomic indicators and market movements.

## Project Structure

- `/data` - Contains datasets used in the project, including historical EURUSD rates and economic indicators.
- `/docs` - Documentation and additional resources related to the project.
- `/models` - Predictive models developed for forecasting currency movements.
- `/notebooks` - Jupyter notebooks for exploratory data analysis, model development, and visualization.
- `/scripts` - Automation scripts for data collection, preprocessing, and model evaluation.

## Key Features (Planned)

The following key features are planned for implementation in this project. They are designed to provide comprehensive insights into forex market trends, particularly focusing on the EURUSD pair:

- **Time Series Analysis**: Utilizing ARIMA and LSTM models to predict future forex rates based on historical data.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Integrating sentiment analysis techniques to assess market sentiment from global financial news and its impact on forex prices.
- **Economic Indicator Analysis**: Examining the influence of major economic announcements and indicators on forex markets.
- **Data Visualization**: Developing interactive dashboards using Plotly/Dash for real-time data visualization and analysis.

These features are in the planning stage and may evolve as the project progresses. Check back for updates as I advance through the development stages.

## Getting Started

This section will guide you through the process of setting up your local environment to run the Advanced Financial Analytics System. Follow these instructions to get started.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure that you have Python installed on your system. You will also need several dependencies, which can be installed using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
````
## Installation
### Clone the Repository
Start by cloning the repository to your local machine. Replace `yourusername` with your GitHub username and adjust the repository name if it's different:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/advanced-financial-analytics-system.git
cd advanced-financial-analytics-system
```
### Set Up Python Environment
It is recommended to use a virtual environment for Python projects to manage dependencies effectively. Here's how you can set it up:

```bash
# Create a virtual environment (Unix/macOS)
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# Create a virtual environment (Windows)
python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\activate
```
### Install Dependencies
With your virtual environment activated, install the project dependencies by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### Environment Configuration
To fully utilize the project's capabilities, set up necessary environment variables:

1.Create a `.env` file in the project root:
```plaintext
touch .env  # Unix/macOS
type nul > .env  # Windows
```

2. Add required environment variables to the `.env` file. For example:
```plaintext
OANDA_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here
```
Replace your_actual_api_key_here with the API key obtained from your data provider, such as OANDA.

### Running the application
Once everything is set up, you can start the application by running:
```bash
python app.py
```
This will launch the application according to the configurations specified in your environment variables and `.env` file.
